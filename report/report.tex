\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Introduction}

This report details my internship with Pierre Rouchon and Igor dotsenko on
Quantum tomography by maximum-likelihood reconstruction. It was done mainly at
the Laboratory Kessler-Brosel (LKB) in the Collège de France but also a bit
\emph{insert Pierre's location here}.

The goal of Quantum tomography is to find ways to reconstruct the state of
a quantum system from several direct or indirect measurement on it. In some case
those measurement do not modify the state of the system. Those are called QND
(Quantum Non-Destructive) measurement.

The specific physical project on which I worked with Igor Dotsenko is the
internship project of Luis Najera about thermodynamics in the case of
atom-cavity interaction in quantum optics. More precisely, we send an circular
Rydberg atom in a resonant cavity containing photons. The state of the cavity is
thermal i.e it follow the Bose-Einstein distribution. The atom then interacts
with the cavity. If the atom is in a thermal state between two atomic level that
are at the same frequency than the cavity then a thermal exchange will occur in
the expected way. However if we pump one of the state of the atom in a hidden
state, like a Maxwell demon, we can can apparently break the second law and make
a cold atom give head to a hotter cavity.

In order to study this experiment, we need to measure the state of the cavity.
That state cannot be measured directly, so we do it by quantum tomography using
maximum-likelihood reconstruction. This construction takes into account all the
measurements made and deduce a density matrix. To find it, one needs to solve a
convex optimisation problem on the set of density matrix (hermitian positive
definite matrix of trace 1). This was done using a gradient descent method with
projection of the gradient on the domain.

The deduced state is usually not a pure state because the reconstruction often
came from a state that has been prepared several times.
All the prepared state are slightly different.
Furthermore, other factors like measurements imperfection and decoherent
relaxation decrease the precision of the reconstruction.

With this measurements, we can now get and interpret the results of our Maxwell
demon experiment. However, to be able to interpret measurement, we need to know
the error on the reconstructed state. The original paper [ref here] on
tomography only provide the standard deviation of usual quantum operator which
are linear in the density matrix. However to do our analysis of the second law,
we need to evaluate the error on the entropy.

In order to do that, I had to extract from the reconstruction the probability
distribution around the maximum which is our estimator. But this distribution
cannot be samples easily because its a mix of Gaussian and exponential law
truncated into the domain of density matrix. Into to sample from this
probability I use an adapted hit and run method to build a Markov chain on the
density matrix space (but discrete time) whose stationary distribution is the
wanted distribution. By sampling this chain long enough, I can get the statistic
average and standard deviation of any real function of the density matrix space.

In the end we get nice plots with errorbars and we were able to determine which
point we realistic within the error-bars and which were completely wrong. We
could then redo the bad point and reach a clean conclusion.

\

This report alternate maths and physics. The odd chapters are about the physical
part of the internship and the even ones about maths. The five first chapter are
about my understanding of prior work that I had to do in order to do what I did.
The last two are about my personal contributions.

In the first chapter I
present the experiment, its modelisation and what we want to prove. In the
second I explain the basics of maximum likelihood reconstruction then I show in
the third chapter how to apply this method for our particular case. In the
fourth chapter I show how to solve the convex optimization problem. Then I can
explain the state of the results before I arrived in chapter 5. In chapter 6 I
explain what I did for computing errorbars for non-linear function and at last
I explain the final results in chapter 7.
